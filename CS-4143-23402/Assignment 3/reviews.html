    I've now had 2 orders cancelled in a row due to no stock available - WEEKS after they were ordered with no communication about it until the cancellation. Emailed about an update for one of the orders only to get an auto-response saying 5-7 days for a response. For an email... in my industry if you took 7 days to return emails you may as well just close your doors. I don't typically leave poor reviews but the lack of communication and customer service for someone who had TWO orders in a row cancelled has prompted this. I would suggest taking a long hard look at your online stocking system and order processing if this is happening regularly.
