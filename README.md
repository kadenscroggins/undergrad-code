# Timeline & Highlights
1. CS-1113 - Computer Science I
    * [Assignment 6](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-1113-60992/Programs/Program6) - Postfix notation calculator. Also called Reverse Polish Notation.
2. CS-2133 - Computer Science II
    * [Assignment 5](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-2133-20918/assn5) - Minesweeper, written in Java - the GUI was programmed by hand without any IDE tools.
3. IS-3003 - System Development Using RAD Tools
    * [Assignment 3](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/IS-3003-30463/assignment3) - "Health Club Calculator" used for calculating membership fees for a country club. This is the 3rd of 12 assignments, but I think it was the best real-world example of a simple JS tool we made.
4. CS-3173 - Basic Computer Architecture
    * All of these assignments were pretty cool, and explored different low-level concepts by simulating them in Java. [Assignment 8](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3173-20256/assignment8) was a State Machine, and [Assignment 10](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3173-20256/assignment10) was dealing with processor registers.
5. CS-3033 - Object Oriented Programming
6. CS-3203 - Application Development in C++
7. CS-3343 - Operating Systems
8. CS-3403 - Data Structures
