# Timeline & Highlights
1. CS-1113 - Computer Science I
    * [Assignment 6](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-1113-60992/Programs/Program6) - Postfix notation calculator. Also called Reverse Polish Notation. Focused on using stack data structures.
2. CS-2133 - Computer Science II
    * [Assignment 5](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-2133-20918/assn5) - Minesweeper, written in Java - the GUI was programmed by hand without any IDE tools.
3. IS-3003 - System Development Using RAD Tools
    * [Assignment 3](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/IS-3003-30463/assignment3) - "Health Club Calculator" used for calculating membership fees for a country club. This is the 3rd of 12 assignments, but I think it was the best real-world example of a simple JS tool we made.
4. CS-3173 - Basic Computer Architecture
    * All of these assignments were pretty cool, and explored different low-level concepts by simulating them in Java. [Assignment 8](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3173-20256/assignment8) was a State Machine, and [Assignment 10](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3173-20256/assignment10) was dealing with processor registers.
5. CS-3033 - Object Oriented Programming
    * [Assignment 3](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3033-31270/Assignment%203) and [Assignment 5](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3033-31270/Assignment%205) are both related to creating and manipulating data in (simple) bank accounts.
6. CS-3203 - Application Development in C++
    * A lot of the assignments in this class were sort of piecemeal bits of exploring different aspects of C++. I think [Assignment 7, problem 3](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3203-30419/Assignment7/Problem%203) is a good example of dividing up code into header files and c++ files, as well as extending one class into another and operating on both classes with vectors.
7. CS-3343 - Operating Systems
    * [Exam 2](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3343-31976/cs%203343%20exam%202%20java%20files%20spring%202021) is a representation of the Dining Philosophers problem. I delved into multithreading, file locks, semaphores, and some other operating system topics like message passing and process control blocks in this course.
8. CS-3403 - Data Structures
    * [Assignment 2](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3403-32066/Assignment2) is an implementation of the Linked List data structire I wrote in C++.
9. CS-3023 - Object Based Visual Programming
    * This class was all Visual Basic. The [Simple Payroll](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-3023-23404/Assignment%208/Simple%20Payroll) section of Assignment 8 is a decent highlight - the .exe is ./obj/x86/debug/Simple Payroll.exe if you wanted to download the folder and run it.
10. CS-4103 - Advanced Java
    * I enjoyed this class a lot. We got to work with streams, lambdas, collectors, and some other higher level topics in Java that I was looking forward to learning when I went into the course. [Assignment 6](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-4103-23401/Assignment%206) is a simple Lambda/Stream/Collector example, and the [Final Exam](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/undergrad-code/tree/main/CS-4103-23401/Final) had us working with Java database drivers.
11. CS-4143 - Web Applications
13. CS-4233 - Professional Development in Computer Science
